# Wetter
### A simple weather application
This site displays the current weather conditions, a 24 hour, and a 4 day forecast for a chosen location. The UI language is German. Dark and light mode as well as a responsive design are provided.

On large screens the forcast has a pagination displaying 6 hours each. On smaller screens (e.g. mobile devices) the forecast can be accessed by horizontal scrolling. An animation simulates this scrolling movement after loading the page.

To get additional information on the cloud cover you can hover over the weather icons.
The data is provided by the open-meteo.com API and is for private use only.
