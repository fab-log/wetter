# Wetter
### A simple weather application
This site displays the current weather conditions, a 24 hour, a 4 day forecast, and a 6 days trend for a chosen location. The UI language is German. It provides dark and light mode as well as a responsive design optimised for large an d small screens.

As an additional feature the user can save favourite locations. These are stored in the browser's cache (localStorage) along with the last chosen location and the selected mode (dark or light).

On large screens the forcast has a pagination displaying 6 hours each. On smaller screens (e.g. mobile devices) the forecast can be accessed by horizontal scrolling. An animation simulates this scrolling movement after loading the page.

The weather data is provided by the open-meteo.com API and is intended for private use only.
